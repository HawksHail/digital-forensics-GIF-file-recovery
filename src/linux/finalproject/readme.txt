We split the assignments throughout the semester evenly.
Then got together as a group and combined them all together into the final program.

assignment 4 - read in superblocks, Zion Mantey
assignment 5 - traverse and read inode, Michael Barre
assignment 6 - file research, David Mendoza
assignment 7 - find first data block of file, Zion Mantey
assignment 8 - add inode to directory, Michael Barre
assignment 9 - find indirect file blocks, David Mendoza

final project - typed by Zion Mantey, all contributed to merging all  assignments together correctly and adding remaining functionality (finding a free inode, calculating size, filling out inode data fields)

See comments in main.c for specifics of who wrote the functions


Usage:
sudo ./finalproject /dev/sdxx (directory block # to add file to)
