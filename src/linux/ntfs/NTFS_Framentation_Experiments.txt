NTFS Fragmentation Experiment Scenarios

Below are a few scenarios to test.  Use mft_reader to get the cluster
runs and see how fragmented a file is.  Before each scenario, you may
want to format the disk to have a more controlled experiment.

Scenario 1:

- Copy two 2MB files individually
- Delete the first one (i.e., one closest to the beginning of the disk)
- Copy a 1MB file

Question: Where does the 1MB file get placed?  Is it where the first 2MB 
          file used to be or is it placed after the second 2MB file?

Scenario 2:

- Copy two 2MB files individually
- Delete the first one
- Copy a 5MB file

Question: Does the 5MB file get fragmented or is it placed after the 
          second 2MB file to keep it contiguous?

Scenario 3:

- Copy as many 'x' MB files until the disk is full
- Delete every other one (This forces a lot of free gaps to appear)
- Copy a large file (roughly half the disk size)

Question: How fragmented does the file become?  Is it possible to have
          too many fragments where a file cannot be copied?  To test this
          you'll have to keep making 'x' smaller and smaller on each run.
