Current commands limit to one (don't mix and match)

./exe/mft_reader [options] <disk_partition_location>

options:

-f : list all files
     sudo ./bin/ntfs -f /dev/sdb1

-l : list all deleted files
     sudo ./bin/ntfs -l /dev/sdb1

-e <entry_idx>
   : print all attributes for entry e
     sudo ./bin/ntfs -e 0 /dev/sdb1

-d <entry_idx>
   : print directory and contents based on mft entry idx
     sudo ./exe/mft_reader -d 5 /dev/sdb1


     
This project is designed to parse an NTFS formatted disk and
completely recover any deleted files.  The current status is
below.

Working (untested):
- NTFS Boot Sector parsed
- MFT File parsed
- Minimal MFT Entry parsing
	- Gets file name
	- Gets cluster runs when file is non-resident

TODO:
- Create a function that recovers data given cluster run list

To compile, run 'make ntfs' in the upper linux/ source directory.  
Executable will be placed in the bin/ folder

To run: ./ntfs <disk_partition_location>
Example: sudo ./ntfs /dev/sdb1

Make sure to point it to the partition and not the MBR.

While the program is running you can enter an entry index
and it will display the relevant information.
